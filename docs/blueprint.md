# **App Name**: TypeFall Challenge

## Core Features:

- Falling Word Generation: Generate random words from a predefined list and make them fall from the top of the screen.
- User Input and Validation: Capture user input via a text field and validate if the typed word matches any of the falling words. Award points and remove the word upon correct entry.
- Scoring and Lives Management: Implement a scoring system where correct words add to the score and missed words reduce lives. Display score and lives on the screen.
- Difficulty Adjustment: Increase the speed and number of falling words based on the player's current score.
- Game Over Screen: Display a game over screen when lives reach zero, showing the final score and providing an option to restart the game.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#4A148C) to evoke a sense of challenge and focus, reminiscent of classic arcade games. 
- Background color: Very dark purple (#1A0038), almost black, providing strong contrast and a classic arcade look. 
- Accent color: Bright yellow (#FFEB3B) to highlight important elements like the score, typed words, and game over messages. 
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for a computerized, techy, scientific feel, suitable for both headlines and shorter blocks of text.
- Simple, minimalist icons for score, lives, and menu options. Use glowing effects to match the game's aesthetic.
- Clean, uncluttered layout with the score and lives at the top, game area in the center, and text input field at the bottom.
- Smooth, consistent falling animation for words. Highlight the word being typed and use a subtle fade-out effect when a word is correctly typed or missed.
